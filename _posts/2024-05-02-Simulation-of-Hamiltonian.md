## Introduction
The paper introduces a new approach to Hamiltonian simulation with exponentially improved performance compared to the past work[^r1]. The key idea is to decompose the Hamiltonian in to a linear combination of unitary operations and implement Taylor series of the evolution operator. The time evolution is broken up into _segments_ each of which is performed using _oblivious amplitude amplification_. 

## Summary of Method
Suppose we are simulating the time evolution of a finite-dimentional Hamiltonian of the form
$$
\begin{equation}
 H = \sum^L_{l=1}\alpha_lH_l
 \label{eq:linear}
\end{equation}
$$
where each $H_l$ is unitary.

Suppose we wish to simulate the evolution under a Hamiltonian $H$ for time $t$:
$$
\begin{equation}
    U:=\exp{-iHt}
    \label{eq:time}
\end{equation}
$$ within error $\epsilon$. Dividing the evolution time into $r$ segments of length $t/r$, the evolution can be approximated as
$$
\begin{equation}
U_r:=\exp(-iHt/r) \approx \sum^K_{k=0}\frac{1}{k!}(-iHt/r)^k,
\label{eq:taylor}
\end{equation}
$$
where the Taylor series is truncated at order $K$.
